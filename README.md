A bunch of client sided mods I use.

## Quick tips:

- Game lagging in windowed mode?
  - Turn off Vsync in the graphics settings. Vsync is broken outside of fullscreen mode.

## Included resource packs:

[H's texture patches](https://github.com/HOSEK1/Hs-Texture-Patches)
and
[Developer art+](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/developer-art-plus/)

## How to download:

[Read this!](https://docs.modrinth.com/docs/modpacks/playing_modpacks/)
Use either ATLauncher, MultiMC, or PolyMC to download the modrinth modpack. There is simply no other easier way unless you want to download each mods manually. All mods used are linked below.
